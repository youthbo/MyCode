Great location, enjoyable stay;;
Excellent house! Wonderful food, extremely helpful staff, directly on the beach, lovely pool, lots of activities, boardwalk to other hotels and restaurants along the beach, gorgeous sunsets, massages on the beach. ;;
We enjoyed a week at this house in a oceanfront room with a family of three. It was a good size and the cleanliness was good.;;
Loved this place. It's set in large beautifully landscaped grounds. ;;
The house's big plus is that it's next to the beach and the view is wonderful.;;
